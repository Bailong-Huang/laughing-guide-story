  A man walks down a street under sunsetting, his loneliness makes him like a 
leaf falling from a tree. He lost his wife and his son by an car accident 
since he was drunk while he was driving.Fortunately he was rescued after the accident, 
but his wife and his son went to heaven ahead of him. He lost his family, and lost everthing. 
He is too sad to live in the world without his family. So he decide to join his family by his own hand, 
with a piece of glass. He place that piece of glass right on his arm. Suddenly he realized that it is 
from his favourite beer brand. Bringing his thought back to the day before the accident. It was a sunny day. 
His wife and his kid had just gotten to the park to have a picnic. He spread out his blanket as his wife 
unpacked the sandwiches. His son playing in the field with the dog. He was happy. Now, he realized the error
of his ways.

  He is tired again, and he did not want to recall some memory about his family. He is depressed, and angry 
to himself. At the moment, he want to go back his apartment and fall asleep on his bed.
