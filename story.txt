  A man walks down a street under sunsetting, his loneliness makes him like a 
leaf falling from a tree. He lost his wife and his son by an car accident 
since he was drunk while he was driving.Fortunately he was rescued after the accident, but his wife and his son went to heaven ahead of him. He lost his family, and lost everthing. He is too sad to live in the world without his family.
